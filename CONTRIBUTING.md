# CPT Bootstrap Carousel: How to Contribute

Hi there, thanks for thinking about contributing! If you would like to make changes
to the code in this plugin and contribute those back to the community, it would
be best if you can use the "Fork and Pull" method. Taken from a
[GitHub help article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/):

> **Fork & pull**
> The fork & pull model lets anyone fork an existing repository and push changes
> to their personal fork without requiring access be granted to the source repository.
> The changes must then be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer.
> This model reduces the amount of friction for new contributors and is popular with
> open source projects because it allows people to work independently without
> upfront coordination.

It usually helps to create an issue before you start coding too - that way we
can discuss any changes before you start writing, and it may help to avoid
writing a feature that is already underway. It also helps to avoid me re-writing
your code to fit in with my vision of how the plugin should work, when you submit your PR :)

Thanks! Any questions, pop an issue.
